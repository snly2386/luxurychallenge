James	Barclay	jbarclay@dreamtown.com	152844	"<strong>2012, 2015 Top Producer, Awarded by the Chicago Association of Realtors</strong><br /><br /><p>Many people, when they think of Realtors, imagine one of the characters from """"Glengarry Glen Ross"""". There is Jack Lemon's character: out of touch, desperate to make a sale for his own survival, pathetic. There is Al Pacino's character: arrogant to the point of revulsion, out to make as much money as possible with little regard for anyone but himself. Then there is Alec Baldwin's character: just an a**hole.</p><p>Me? I don't fit into any of those stereotypes. I'm just a regular guy. And a nice guy to boot.</p><p>My job, and I take it very seriously, is to help people. Usually that means assisting them in buying or selling a home. It often involves educating them to the way the process works and informing them of all their options. It frequently includes explaining the current market conditions and referring them to an attorney, lender, home inspector or moving company whom I trust. Sometimes it even means telling them now is not the time for them to buy or sell and helping them construct a long term plan to achieve their goals.</p><p>I began in the industry in 2005 and have seen my business grow steadily each year--despite the current market challenges. By serving both buyers and sellers, I gain valuable insight to the needs and motivations of each.  That, in turn, allows me negotiate for my clients strategically and effectively--getting them the best possible deal for their money.</p><p>In addition to working with sellers and """"move up"""" buyers, I particularly enjoy helping first time home buyers realize their goal of home ownership.  I am the organizer of the First Time Chicago Home Buyer's Group on Meetup.com and I host a series of regular workshops designed specifically for first time home buyers.</p><p>My background is somewhat atypical for a Realtor. I hold a Bachelor of Music from the University of North Texas and for ten years I made my living solely as a professional drummer. I have recorded, performed and toured throughout the US and Europe. Many people are surprised to learn this but for me the path to success in both careers has been the same: hard work, honesty and integrity. Most importantly, when given the opportunity to perform &mdash; on stage or as an advocate for a buyer or seller &mdash; I do the best job I possibly can and completely exceed expectations.</p><p>By doing so, I have been able to build my business largely on the referrals of past clients who appreciate the work that I did for them. Don't just take my word for it. Read for yourself what people are saying about me in their testimonials and on Yelp.com.</p><p>...and yes, I still do perform on the drums as time allows.  It's a thrill to invite my clients to a club gig or a theater show I'm in and let them see the """"other"""" me.</p>"	http://www.dreamtown.com/images/agents/formal/300px/jbarclay.jpg	142246	773 945 0140	US

Karin	Austin	karin.austin@dreamtown.com	186532	"<p>Like many good real estate career beginnings, mine happened quite by chance. In preparing for a move of my own in 2006, I discovered I had an unusual metabolism for searching through property listings due to my love affair with interior design. My family watched me obsess over inventory for days and months on end in search of a Denver, CO loft and they wondered out loud how I could stay so tirelessly connected to a process they found stressful and exhausting. Truth was, I actually enjoyed the hunt very much and while I didn't know it then, that search would turn out to be one of the true """"when peanut butter met chocolate"""" moments of my life.</p><p>Right about the time I was settling into my new home, I accepted an opportunity to partner in a small real estate investment business in Boulder. While there, in addition to serving as the team's interior design consultant, I spent three years learning to assess risk, analyze costs against benefits, and think critically about real estate investment strategy. Some of the most poignant lessons I learned happened when the market crashed in 2008. Now, while I know there aren't many of us who enjoy growing through failures, I do believe most of us would agree that the wisdom gleaned from our most difficult experiences are the ones which tend to give the highest rates of return on time invested, if we are truly paying attention. As you might imagine, by the time that experience was finished with me, I was definitely paying attention and I emerged from it a much wiser business woman and entrepreneur.</p><p>After closing shop and picking up the pieces of my shattered investment dreams, I decided it was time for a new start. In 2009 I moved to Chicago determined to parlay my interior design and house-hunting skills into a paying job. I was fortunate to immediately find a position with one of Chicago's top apartment locating agencies. For anyone who isn't familiar with the rental market in Chicago, working it is very similar to working a sales market... on steroids. After successfully placing over 200 clients, I completed my freshman year with an expert level of knowledge about Chicago and its many unique neighborhoods. Confident I was a good fit for the profession, I acquired my broker's license in 2010 with the intention of putting my talents to work on behalf of buyers and sellers who needed help navigating their way through a dynamic sales marketplace.</p><p>In the last four years I have come to truly understand the value I offer my clients. Time and again, I have tapped into my experiences with real estate investment, interior design, and renovation project management to empower both buyers and sellers with the information they need to feel relaxed and confident about one of the most emotional and complex financial transactions they'll make in their life. In the heart of my business, I continue to hold a special affinity for buyers and I still thoroughly enjoy the hunt for that near-perfect place we all hope to find in our search for a new home. Alternately, for sellers, I am able to help minimize the number of days a home spends on market while maximizing the bottom line of each sale, by ensuring a property has been appropriately staged and priced before it is introduced to buyers. Even though we have now moved into a seller's market, it is still crucial for a seller to remove any obstacles that might prevent a buyer from making an offer. We want to give buyers very few reasons to say """"no"""" and every reason to say """"yes"""" after they've walked through your front door. If we fail to do that, today's savvy buyer will more often than not, turn on their heals and move on to the next turnkey opportunity that offers better value for the same price.</p><p>If it happens that your next move is looming on the horizon and you would like some help finding a place to live, or if you'd like to speak with me regarding the marketing of your home, please don't hesitate to contact me with any questions you might have. I welcome the opportunity to have a conversation with you and am happy to assist in any way I can. Truth be told, I always enjoy building new relationships within the community and being of service whenever possible. Doing so seems to keep a wellspring of positive energy flowing into my life and it continually deepens my appreciation for the shared experiences we recognize in each other's stories as we get to know one another.</p>"	http://www.dreamtown.com/images/agents/formal/300px/karin.austin.jpg	142246	773 614 0305	US

Due to their focus, knowledge, experience, and commitment, Suzannah and Ivona both grew their businesses dramatically during the downturn and subsequent recession of the Real Estate Market, guiding their seller and buyer clients through ever-changing selling and purchase cycles. As the market has begun to recover, the skills learned and experience gained during those challenging times set Suzannah and Ivona far apart from their colleagues, many of whom gave up on the business altogether.</p><p>Both Suzannah and Ivona are multimillion dollar producers and repeatedly qualify as Top Producers, but to them, sales volume represents not their personal or professional value but the satisfaction of their past and current clients who return to them for their ongoing real estate needs as well as refer them enthusiastically to friends and loved ones. Their success by the numbers is a reflection of the assurance their clients feel. Their ability to relate to others, to listen, and understand their clients' needs inspires confidence and trust that lead to lifetime relationships.</p><p>Ivona emigrated to the United States from Poland in 1990. After living in New York City and Chicago, she settled in Evanston in 1994. These relocations allow her to empathize with the uprooting involved in the moving process and enable her to respond to her clients' needs in a caring and understanding manner.

She is also a certified Relocation and Negotiations Specialist.</p><p>Suzannah graduated with a BA from the University of Chicago in 1992, after which she co-founded a wildly successful computer consulting company in Chicago. Bootstrapping a business from one person to 50 employees within a year was an exciting challenge and forced Suzannah to juggle many balls at all times. There she learned flexibility, out-of-the-box thinking, strategic negotiation, contract development and presentation, and how to provide top-notch customer service with humor and grace. During her years in real estate, she has leaned a tremendous amount about common inspection and appraisal issues and has built a team of resources to protect her buyer and seller clients from the resolvable problems, leading to safer homes and worry-free clients.</p><p>Ivona and Suzannah are true complements to one another; highly similar in style, experience and personality but with some important differences that allow us to provide our clients with an exceptional array of talents as a team. Currently, Ivona is splitting her time between Poland and the US, which allows the team to capitalize on an extended work day due to the time difference. Suzannah provides ground coverage, Ivona provides marketing, research, and negotiations support and everybody wins. Thanks to cutting-edge technology, focus, and determination, the team easily manages unconventional business model which we believe takes courage and high level of commitment. We are thrilled to report that a proof-of-concept trial period went beyond our wildest hopes.</p><p>We look forward to working with you and proving to you how dedicated we are to advocating for you through the process of purchasing and/or selling.</p>"	http://www.dreamtown.com/images/agents/formal/300px/imccormick.jpg	142249	847 471 2200	US

Growing up one of her mom's favorite Sunday hobbies was to go to open houses all around Chicago and the suburbs to see what was new and happening. After an afternoon of exploring they would discuss all the things they liked, didn't like and what they would change about the properties they saw. After hundreds of Sunday adventures Christina gained a wealth of knowledge about different properties... and some pretty interesting stories. This knowledge led to her first career as a mortgage lender in 2003. Her favorite clients were first time home buyers because, in her opinion, the journey and education that accompanies a client's first home purchase never gets old.</p><p>During her years as a lender Christina participated in many networking and education opportunities to grow her business and meet new people. Then in 2005 she discovered the Chicago Area Gay & Lesbian Chamber of Commerce during a conversation with one of her mentors. Instantly she found a business community that she could build amazing relationships with and give back to. Through this great network and her volunteer spirit Christina went on to leave the lending community and become the organizations President & CEO in January 2007. For the next eight years Christina led the organization to new heights while growing as a leader and a professional. In 2009 Christina became the Midwest Regional Chamber for the National Gay and Lesbian Chamber of Commerce's Council of Chambers and Business Organizations. In this role she was able to work with and advise LGBT chambers of commerce all over the Midwest. During her time in both of these roles she was able to speak locally and nationally about LGBT business inclusion and education, supplier diversity and LGBT consumer buying power. In 2014 Christina decided to return to her real estate roots but this time on the other side of the transaction and teamed up with her new partners in crime, Sam Powell and Jen Thompson, when she joined the Ask for Sam Team at Dream Town.</p><p>Over the years Christina has lived in many of Chicago's neighborhoods and the surrounding suburbs but currently resides with her fianc? Melissa and their son Dominic in Uptown. When she is not out exploring Chicago's neighborhoods or hanging out with family in the burbs you can find her enjoying Chicago sports, on the softball field or on the sidelines coaching and cheering at her son's baseball games. Christina is still an active member of the Chicago Area Gay & Lesbian Chamber of Commerce, volunteers with the Chicago Force women's tackle football team and Women's Council of Realtor's Chicago Chapter. Outside of sports and volunteering Christina is passionate about all things British, loves a great cup of coffee, going to the movies and spending time with family.</p>"	http://www.dreamtown.com/images/agents/formal/300px/cpinson.jpg	142705	630 347 0513	US

Becoming an international recording artist allowed him the opportunity of touring and performing alongside the biggest bands and artists in the world. Their albums hit the billboard charts, and their songs continue to be played on radio and TV shows across the globe. Playing drums since the age of 8, music still remains a big part of Bob&rsquo;s life, as he continues to write, record and perform.</p><p>Bob is extremely proud of his Hellenic heritage. Being first generation Greek, hard work and loyalty were instilled in him at a young age. He goes back to Greece every year to visit his family, and he&rsquo;s proud to be able to converse with them fluently in Greek. With grapes and olive trees growing on family soil, he is determined to one day makes his own wine!</p>"	http://www.dreamtown.com/images/agents/formal/300px/bkourelis.jpg	142705	773 213 4073	US
